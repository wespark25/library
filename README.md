Data is handled by Hibernate, MAMP, and MySql.

WARNING as of 1-20-2020 if you log in with incorrect credentials you will recieve a bug. This will be fixed very soon.


If you are demoing the application begin by logging into admin. After you are logged in feel free to add a few books and
authors by clicking the appropriate links on the nav bar. Next, remove one of the authors you previously created. If you move
over to the remove books page you will notice that all books associated with the deleted author have been removed as well. When
you are satisfied with your new selection of books, logout.

Now login with user. When logged in select browse from the nav bar. Here you will see the books and authors you created. Add some of the books to your cart.
After you are satisfied with your book selection head to checkout. At checkout simply click the button at the bottom to proceed and add the books to your backpack.
When you are finsished reading the non-existent contents of those books, go to return. Select all the books you want to return and click the button at the bottom.
